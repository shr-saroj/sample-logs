# Sample Logs for Nginx and Apache Web Servers for Data Visualization

This GitHub repository contains sample log files for both Nginx and Apache web servers that can be used for data visualization purposes. The logs are generated by sample servers running on a local machine and contain information about incoming HTTP requests and responses.

## Nginx Logs

The Nginx logs are stored in the following format:
